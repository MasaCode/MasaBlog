                p Currently I am studying game development at ITD Canada and looking for great Opportunities to work as a game developer or a software developer. I've been programming since I was 15. In Junior hight my friend taught me how to program and I really loved it. For me, programming has been a great tool to express my imagination. Then at high school and college intergrated education instutute back in Japan, I chose programming as my major. Also I really love playing video games. As I studied programming deeply, I realized how great it would be to combine my two passions together. Then I found out Vancouver is not only a beautiful city, but has many great game companies. That's why I moved to Vancouver and started studying game development at ITD Canada. When I am not programming, I'm cooking, reading, watching movies,playing games, or working out.
